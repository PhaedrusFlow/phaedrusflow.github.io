# **PERSONAL INTERESTS AND HOBBIES**

My passions include riding and tinkering with my motorcycle "Phaedrus”, as well as embarking on family outings with my wife Katy and our dogs Dempsey and Zen. When the weather doesn't cooperate, I find solace in manga and anime, with favorites like Demon Slayer, Black Clover, Spy X Family, and HunterXHunter. Additionally, I'm dedicated to building and teaching pragmatic deep tech within the community through outreach and my Qompass Pathfinders intern program.
